              Nigeria is yawning for a positive psychological transformation. The system
              and its components are in dare need of serious mental transformation. To get 
              things right again in Nigeria, we need to start thinking and acting right.
              <strong style="color:green">Re-animated Nigeria</strong> is a group bore out of the desire to 
              see that things work right in Nigeria once again. A movement to preach the message of positive
              transformation especially in the minds of young Nigerians who will take over the 
              mantle of leadership
            in the nearest future.<strong style="color:green">Re-animated Nigeria</strong> is poised towards 
              spreading the good news that corruption must not be our lifestyle and can be eradicated to a high extent.

              At <strong style="color:green">Re-animated Nigeria</strong>, we lay hold to the eternal 
              creed that has been the companion of great patriots all around the world, the creed
              that our country can rise and will rise again. for many, this is too risky a hope and we know,
              however,as all patriots know, the risk of not trying to make a difference is a bigger risk
              compared to the risk of failure that exist in trying to be the light that blazes the 
              path for national animation.
              This is a task we have committed our lifetime to and whether we sail or swim,
              Nigeria shall rise in our lifetime.
